# Angularjs Tutorial for Beginners - learn Angular.js using UI-Router

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QETUuZ27N0w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Working Angularjs Code Sample on Plunkr: http://plnkr.co/tZg6EfbMCJX1MLtUAcb1
This tutorial will teach you how to build a single page javascript application using Angular.js from Google. Angular is an amazing framework for rapid development and building stable apps with little effort.

I'm using UI-Router (https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) for this example, as I really like the way that functions over angular's built-in router.

Once you get used to "the angular way", you'll be building an angular.js application in no time.

Angular's templating, two-way data binding, and great way of separating concerns makes it an all-around great javascript framework.

NOTE: At 30:15, there's an error because I forgot to change the Home Controller to match the new service syntax on line 5:  
Friends.get().then(function(data) {  
$scope.friends = data;  
});

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLa2LxMdAPs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Let's build an E-Commerce site FAST with Angular and Moltin.
Signup for Moltin's Free Tier Here: http://midga.me/1zSkKYS

Again, this is a sponsored video - Moltin asked if I'd be interested in featuring their product, and I clearly approve.

Wanna see a full-blown implementation in angular? They have one on github: https://github.com/moltin/js-demo

Moltin Intro Video: http://youtu.be/Icltr-6nRLg
Yeoman Intro Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKiaLSJW5xI&list=PLoYCgNOIyGAB0_YBfdNP5oqAD98HtAQqL&index=8

So what we're going to do here is use Yeoman Generator-Angular to scaffold out an Angular app for us and generate routes. Then, we're going to use Moltin's E-Commerce API's to create an E-Commerce site with Angular in just minutes!

The great thing about Moltin, is you can have all of your inventory, products, orders, shipping, etc 100% separated from your application codebase - this is a GREAT separation of concerns in my opinion.
